Smirk is a chemistry-specific tokenizer that provides complete coverage of the [OpenSMILES]
specification, that is built using Rust ðŸ¦€ and [HuggingFace's tokenizers][Tokenizers] ðŸ¤—.
Installation is easy, and Smirk works out-of-the-box with the [HuggingFace] ecosystem.

Check out [Getting Started](smirk_demo.ipynb) to see `smirk` in action, or [read the paper][paper] to learn
about tokenization for molecular foundation models.

## Why Smirk?

Molecular Foundation Models are demonstrating impressive performance, but current models use tokenizers
that fail to represent *all* of chemistry, inherently limiting their performance.
`smirk` fixes this by tokenizing SMILES encodings all the way down to their constituent elements.
Enabling complete coverage of [OpenSMILES] with a vocabulary of 167 tokens.
